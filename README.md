# HCV-Disease-Prediction
This is a group project done in R as a part of my degree at Columbia University

# Abstract

Over the past few years, statistical learning has had a signiﬁcant impact on the 
medical community. It has provided healthcare workers with new tools for analyz- 
ing and interpreting data to make more informed decisions about patient care. It 
has also aided us by identifying patterns and relationships in the data that may not 
be immediately evident to humans.
In this paper we have tried to predict if a certain individual has, Hepatitis C, a viral 
infection of the liver that can lead to serious complications if left untreated. The 
dataset for this task was obtained from the UCI Database and contains the infor- 
mation for over 600 participants. Using attributes such as participants’ age, gender 
and liver function test results, we aim at building several machine learning models 
that can accurately detect the presence of Hepatitis as well as classify between the 
various stages of the disease - Hepatitis, Cirrhosis and Fibrosis. In addition to repli- 
cating the results of some papers utilizing this dataset, we experiment with some 
well known ML models and obtain substantial results which can be utlilized for the 
timely diagnosis and treatment of Hepatitis C.

# Conclusion

The implications of the severity of Hepatitis C can be clearly gauged by the sheer widespread 
and chronic nature of this disease. Thus, its timely diagnosis and treatment is one of the most 
relevant problems in the medical ﬁeld. In an attempt to abet in the alleviation of this issue, 
we propose a pipeline which, using the HCV dataset from UCI database, presents a thorough 
analysis of its various attributes and machine learning models that help in the prediction of the 
presence as well as classiﬁcation between the stages of chronic Hepatitis. Among our models, 
Random Forest is able to achieve best results with a high accuracy of 93.51%
